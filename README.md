# build-your-own-git-basics
This repository guides you through the implementation of basic Git functionalities, including initializing a local repository, adding files to the staging area, committing changes with messages, checking the status of your working directory, and viewing the commit history. It also covers essential underlying mechanisms like content hashing and compression.

This implementation relies solely on Python's standard library, eliminating the need for a virtual environment.

To experiment with this tool, ensure you have some `.txt` or `.py` files readily available for tracking and committing.

## Start Implementing
Each file contains prompts to guide you through completing the implementation of basic Git functionalities. You'll progress through versions of each feature, starting with the simplest approach and gradually building towards a closer approximation of actual Git.
